MyToken - A Simple ERC20 Token
This README provides an overview of the MyToken smart contract, including its purpose, functionality, and usage instructions.

Overview
MyToken is a basic implementation of an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation, transfer, and destruction of tokens, adhering to the standard requirements of such tokens. This document outlines the key features and functionalities of the MyToken contract.

Requirements
The MyToken contract meets the following requirements:

Public Variables: The contract includes public variables to store the token name (tokenName), abbreviation (tokenAbbrv), and total supply (totalSupply).
Address-Balance Mapping: A mapping (balances) tracks the balance of tokens held by each address.
Mint Function: Allows the creation of new tokens by specifying an address and the number of tokens to mint. This increases both the total supply and the recipient's balance.
Burn Function: Enables the destruction of tokens by specifying an address and the number of tokens to burn. This decreases both the total supply and the sender's balance, subject to certain conditions.
Conditional Checks: The burn function includes checks to ensure that the sender has sufficient tokens to burn.
Contract Code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract MyToken {
    // Public variables
    string public tokenName = "META";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "MTA";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // Address-balance mapping
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // Mint function
    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    // Burn function
    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
        require(balances[_address] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances[_address] -= _value;
    }
}
Usage Instructions
Deploying the Contract
To deploy the MyToken contract, you need to interact with it through a Solidity development environment like Remix IDE or Truffle. Ensure you have the contract code saved in a .sol file.

Minting Tokens
To mint new tokens, call the mint function with the recipient's address and the number of tokens to mint. For example:

myTokenInstance.mint(recipientAddress, amount);
Burning Tokens
To burn tokens, call the burn function with the sender's address and the number of tokens to burn. Ensure the sender has enough tokens to cover the burn amount. Example:

myTokenInstance.burn(senderAddress, amount);
Security Considerations
Always test contracts thoroughly in a safe environment before deploying them to mainnet.
Be cautious of potential reentrancy attacks, especially when modifying state variables.
Regularly audit and update the contract to mitigate vulnerabilities.
Conclusion
MyToken serves as a foundational example of an ERC20 token contract. It demonstrates the core functionalities required for managing a cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain.
